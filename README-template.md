## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
### What I learned
 With the project I was able to dig up old JavaScript knowledge that I had buried under so much React knowledge. <br/>

  Getting aquainted with function calls, scoping, etc was the hardest part to remember becasue of how easy React made it with JSX.

```js
document.getElementByID(".some-element")
```
```js
function mainFunction(parameter){
  ///your code here...
OtherFunction(parameter)
}

function OtherFunction(parameter){
  ///your code here...
}
```
